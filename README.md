This project is the capstone assignment for the 2019 [LaunchCode Data Science course](https://www.launchcode.org/codergirl). It aims to model and predict the presence of heart disease in patients by using a 1988 dataset of patient information from the Cleveland database, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). 

The project is divided into three separate Jupyter notebooks:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Modeling
3. Conclusions
