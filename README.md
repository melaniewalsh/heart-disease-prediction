# Predicting and Analyzing Heart Disease with Machine Learning

This project is the capstone assignment for the spring 2019 [Data Science course](https://www.launchcode.org/codergirl) hosted by [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/). It aims to model and predict the presence of heart disease in patients by using binary classification machine learning algorithms (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, Naive Bayes) and a dataset of patient information, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). 

The project is divided into three separate Jupyter notebooks:

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb)
2. [Modeling](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/Modeling.ipynb)
3. [Conclusions](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/Conclusions.ipynb)
